# RIFT_pe_public_samples
A repository which either contains or provides links to RIFT PE results.
Each directory will contain a README.md describing the samples *and marginalized likeihood tables* available for that event (e.g., including multiple calibrations/settings and approximations), the appropriate citation (or a citation to this repository), and a link to a corresponding hosting repository (if hosted elsewhere).
